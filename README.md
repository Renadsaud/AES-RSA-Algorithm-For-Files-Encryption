# AES-RSA-Algorithm-For-Files-Encryption
In this project we will encrypt a file and send it over the internet using both symmetric and asymmetric key approaches, AES algorithm is to be used for encrypting data, and RSA algorithm is to be used to protect the AES key. The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone. The AES algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 128 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
