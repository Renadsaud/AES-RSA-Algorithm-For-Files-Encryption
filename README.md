# AES-RSA-Algorithm-For-Files-Encryption
Our project was designed to help users communicate and send files to each other securely. Our application provides secure registration and login services and we make sure that each user has their special username and password. We are following the public and private key approach by using both AES and RSA algorithms to encrypt and decrypt the files, AES algorithm is to be used for encrypting data, and the RSA algorithm is to be used to protect the AES key. Our system also has the ability to work via the network.


# What is the RSA algorithm?
The RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm; this means that it uses a public key and a private key (i.e. two different, mathematically linked keys). As their names suggest, a public key is shared publicly, while a private key is secret and must not be shared with anyone. 

# What is the AES algorithm?
The AES algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 128 bits and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

# This project consists of Tasks:
 1- How to Read the plaintext file.
 <br/>
 2- Save the encrypted file as a file.
  <br/>
 3- Create a TCP connection between the sender and the receiver.
  <br/>
 4- How to connect the algorithm RSA and AES with our code.
  <br/>
 5- How to protect password.

# The programming language used
we used Java language to implement and design the interface.
